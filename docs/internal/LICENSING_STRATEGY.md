## License Enforcement Mechanisms

### **1. License Key System**

**Generation:**

```
Format: LLLL-TTTT-NNNN-CCCC-HHHH
- L = License tier (FREE, STRT, PROF, PREM, ENTP)
- T = Timestamp (Unix epoch, base36)
- N = Customer ID (numeric)
- C = Random component (entropy)
- H = HMAC signature (prevent tampering)

Example: PROF-A7K9M-12345-R8Q2-9F3D
```

**Storage:**

- Client-side: `~/.seed/license.key`
- Server-side: License database (customer_id, license_key, tier, expiry, max_devices)

**Validation:**

1. Parse license key
2. Verify HMAC signature
3. Check expiration date
4. Validate tier matches features in use
5. Cloud validation (once per 24 hours)

---

### **2. Device Fingerprinting**

**Purpose:** Prevent license sharing across organizations

**Fingerprint Components:**

- MAC address of primary interface
- Hostname
- CPU ID (if available)
- Installation UUID (generated on first run)

**Enforcement:**

- Free tier: 1 device per license
- Starter: Up to 3 devices (laptop, desktop, server)
- Pro/Premium/Enterprise: Up to 5 devices
- Enterprise (custom): Negotiate for large deployments

**Behavior:**

- Soft limit: Warning after device limit exceeded
- Hard limit: Block activation after 2x device limit
- Device deactivation: Allow user to deactivate old devices via portal

---

### **3. Cloud License Validation**

**Frequency:**

- Every 24 hours (online check)
- Grace period: 7 days offline (after last successful validation)
- After grace period: Downgrade to Free tier features

**Validation Endpoint:**

```
POST https://license.seed.com/api/v1/validate
{
  "license_key": "PROF-...",
  "device_fingerprint": "sha256(MAC+hostname+uuid)",
  "version": "0.110.0",
  "features_in_use": ["ai_analysis", "vuln_scan"]
}

Response:
{
  "valid": true,
  "tier": "professional",
  "expires": "2026-12-15T00:00:00Z",
  "features_enabled": [...],
  "max_devices": 200,
  "api_quota": 100
}
```

**Offline Mode:**

- Cache last validation response
- Allow offline use for 7 days
- After 7 days: Show warning, downgrade to Free features
- Healthcare exception: 30-day grace period (air-gapped environments)

---

### **4. Feature Gating**

**Backend Feature Flags:**

```go
type LicenseTier int

const (
    TierFree LicenseTier = iota
    TierStarter
    TierProfessional
    TierPremium

    switch feature {
    case "ai_classification":
        return l.Tier >= TierStarter
    case "ai_root_cause":
        return l.Tier >= TierProfessional
    case "predictive_survey":
        return l.Tier >= TierPremium
    case "fleet_management":
        return l.Tier >= TierEnterprise
    default:
        return false
    }
}

## License Compliance & Auditing

### **Usage Telemetry**

**What We Track (Privacy-Preserving):**

- Device count (number of devices monitored)
- API call volume
- Error rates and crashes (anonymous)

**What We DON'T Track:**

- Network topology
- Device details (IPs, MACs, hostnames)
- Vulnerability data
- User data (PHI, PCI, PII)
- Geographic location (unless consented)

**Opt-Out:**

- Enterprise customers can disable telemetry (on-prem mode)
- Must validate license via manual process quarterly

---

### **Audit Rights**

**Enterprise Contracts:**

- The Seed reserves right to audit license usage annually
- Advance notice: 30 days
- Customer provides device count, site count, user count
- If over-usage found: Pay true-up + 10% penalty OR terminate

**Grace Period:**

- 30 days to remediate over-usage (buy more licenses)
- No penalty if resolved within grace period

---

## License Violations & Enforcement

### **Violation Types**

1. **Key Sharing:** Same license key used across multiple organizations
2. **Device Limit Exceeded:** More devices than license allows
3. **Feature Hacking:** Attempting to enable premium features on lower tier
4. **Expired License:** Continuing use after expiration without renewal

### **Enforcement Actions**

- In-app banner: "Please upgrade or reduce devices"
- 14-day grace period to comply

**Tier 2 (Soft Block):**

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE licenses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL,
    license_key_hash TEXT NOT NULL,  -- HMAC(license_key)
    tier TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 'free', 'starter', 'pro', 'premium', 'enterprise'
    status TEXT NOT NULL,             -- 'active', 'suspended', 'expired', 'canceled'
    max_devices INT,
    issued_at TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_validated TIMESTAMP,
    device_fingerprints JSONB         -- Array of device fingerprints
);

CREATE INDEX idx_license_hash ON licenses(license_key_hash);
```

---

### **Client-Side:**

**Storage Location:**

- Linux: `~/.config/seed/license.key`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/The Seed/license.key`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\The Seed\license.key`

**Permissions:**

- Warn if permissions too open

---

## License Transfer & Ownership

### **Company Acquisition:**

### **Resale/Transfer (Not Allowed):**

- Licenses are non-transferable between unrelated entities
- Cannot sell license to another company
- Exception: Asset sale with written approval

---

## Open Source & Community

### **Open Core Model (Future Consideration):**

**Option:** Make core network monitoring open source, premium features proprietary

**Pros:**

- Community contributions
- Transparency builds trust
- Easier adoption
- Marketing value

**Cons:**

- Competitors can fork
- Harder to monetize
- Support burden

**Decision:** Postpone until after initial product-market fit (Year 2+)
