# MediaTek Wi-Fi Adapters

⚠️ **Mixed Support** - MediaTek chipsets have improving Linux support but still lag behind Intel. Some work well, others
have limitations. **Intel or Atheros preferred for reliability**.

[← Back to Home](Home)

## 📊 Compatibility Overview

### Why MediaTek is Improving

#### Recent Progress

- `mt76` driver in mainline kernel (actively developed)
- Improving nl80211 support
- Some chipsets support monitor mode
- Better than Realtek, not as good as Intel

#### Remaining Issues

- Monitor mode support varies by chipset
- Packet injection limited
- Signal quality accuracy inconsistent
- Some chipsets require firmware

**Recommendation:** If you already have MediaTek hardware, test it. For new purchases, **Intel AX200/210 still
preferred** for reliability.

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### Verify MediaTek Chipset

````bash
lspci | grep -i mediatek
# Example: MediaTek Inc. MT7921 802.11ax

lsusb | grep -i mediatek
# For USB adapters
```text

### Check Driver Status

```bash
lsmod | grep mt76
# Should show:
# mt7921e (or mt7922e, mt76x2u, etc.)
# mt76_connac_lib
# mt76
```text

### Install Firmware (if needed)

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-firmware

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S linux-firmware

# Verify firmware loaded
dmesg | grep -i mediatek
```text

### Test Monitor Mode

```bash
# Check if supported
iw list | grep -A 10 "Supported interface modes"
# Look for: * monitor

# Attempt to enable
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up

# Verify
iw dev wlan0 info
```yaml

#### Expected Result

- MT7921: May work on kernel 5.15+, unstable on older kernels
- MT7922: Limited, especially on 6GHz
- MT7612U: Partial support

## 🔧 Improving Monitor Mode Support

### Update to Latest Kernel

MediaTek support improves with each kernel version:

```bash
# Check current kernel
uname -r

# Ubuntu: Use HWE kernel for latest version
sudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-22.04

# Or use mainline kernel (advanced)
# https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
```bash

#### Recommended Kernels

- MT7921: 5.15+ (better with 6.0+)
- MT7922: 6.0+ (6.1+ preferred)

### Update Firmware

```bash
# Get latest linux-firmware
cd /tmp
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
sudo cp -r linux-firmware/mediatek/* /lib/firmware/mediatek/
sudo update-initramfs -u
```yaml

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue: Monitor Mode Fails on MT7921

#### Error

```text
command failed: Operation not supported (-95)
```text

#### Solution

```bash
# Update to kernel 5.15 or newer
uname -r  # Check current version

# If kernel <5.15, upgrade
sudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-22.04
sudo reboot
```text

### Issue: Firmware Loading Failure

#### Error

```text
mt7921e: Failed to load firmware
mt7921e: Download BIN timeout
```python

#### Solution

```bash
# Reinstall firmware
sudo apt install --reinstall linux-firmware

# Or get latest from git (see above)
```yaml

### Issue: Inconsistent Signal Quality

**Symptom:** Signal strength jumps ±10 dBm

**Cause:** Driver reporting inconsistency

**Workaround:** Average readings over time, or use external Intel adapter for accurate measurements

## 🛒 Should You Buy MediaTek Hardware?

### ⚠️ **Maybe** - For Budget Builds

#### When MediaTek makes sense

- Budget constraint (often cheaper than Intel)
- Managed mode only (no diagnostics)
- Latest kernel available (6.0+)

#### When to choose Intel instead

- Need reliable monitor mode
- Site surveys and diagnostics
- 6GHz with monitor mode
- Packet injection
- Professional/production use

#### Price Comparison

- MediaTek MT7921: $12-18 USD
- Intel AX200: $15-25 USD
- **Difference:** $3-7 → **Choose Intel for $7 more**

### ✅ **Yes** - If You Already Own It

If your laptop has MediaTek Wi-Fi:

1. Update to latest kernel (6.0+)
2. Test monitor mode capability
3. Works? Great! Doesn't work? Buy external USB adapter
