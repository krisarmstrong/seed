## ⚠️ Consumer Broadcom NICs (Limited/No TDR)

### BCM57XX Series (Desktop/Laptop)

**Basic NICs - Limited TDR Support**

- **Chipsets:** BCM5751, BCM5761, BCM5784
- **Driver:** `tg3`
- **TDR Support:** ⚠️ **Limited or None**

**Status:**

- May support basic cable status (OK/fault)
- **No distance measurement**
- **No fault location**
- Not recommended for diagnostics

**Testing:**

```bash
sudo ethtool --cable-test eth0
# Often returns: Operation not supported
```

---

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

### Verify Broadcom Chipset

```bash
lspci | grep -i broadcom
# Example output:
# 01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Inc. NetXtreme BCM5719 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe

# Check driver
ethtool -i eth0 | grep driver
# Should show: tg3
```

### Test TDR Support

```bash
sudo ethtool --cable-test eth0

# BCM5719/5720: Should work
# Cable test started for eth0.
# Cable test completed for eth0.
# Pair A code: OK
# Pair A length: 15m
# (etc.)

# BCM57XX: May fail
# netlink error: Operation not supported
```

## 📊 TDR Performance (BCM5719/5720)

### Accuracy

- Cable length: ±3-5m
- Fault distance: ±3-5m
- Test time: ~15-30 seconds

### Comparison to Intel

- **Similar accuracy** to Intel I350/I210
- **Slightly slower** test execution
- **Equally reliable** for fault detection

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue: TDR Not Working on BCM57XX

**Cause:** Consumer chipsets don't support TDR

**Solution:** Purchase Intel I210 or server-grade Broadcom (BCM5719/5720)

### Issue: Driver Module Not Loading

**Symptoms:**

```
tg3: module not found
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Install driver
sudo modprobe tg3

# Make permanent
echo "tg3" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```
