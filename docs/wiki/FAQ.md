# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General

### What is The Seed?

The Seed is an AI-powered network diagnostic platform that combines WiFi planning, network monitoring, vulnerability
scanning, and compliance reporting in one affordable tool.

It tells you **what's wrong** with your network and **how to fix it** - not just data dumps.

### Who is The Seed for?

- **Healthcare IT:** Hospitals, clinics, medical practices (HIPAA compliance built-in)
- **SMB Network Admins:** Small/medium businesses (50-500 employees)
- **WiFi Consultants:** Budget-conscious consultants doing site surveys
- **MSPs:** Managed service providers managing client networks

### Is The Seed free?

**Free tier:** Yes! Up to 50 devices, community support, no AI features.

#### Paid tiers

- Starter: $299/year (200 devices, AI classification)
- Professional: $799/year (unlimited devices, full AI)
- Premium: $1,999/year (predictive WiFi planning)
- Enterprise: $4,999/year (multi-site fleet management)

## Installation and Setup

### What platforms does The Seed support?

#### Supported

- macOS (Ventura 13.0+, Apple Silicon + Intel)
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 11+, RHEL 8+)
- Docker (cross-platform)

#### Not supported (yet)

- Windows (planned for future release)
- Mobile (iOS/Android - planned for WiFi survey mobile app)

### Do I need to be root/admin to run The Seed?

**macOS:** Yes, packet capture requires elevated privileges. Run with `sudo seed` or grant network access permissions.

**Linux:** Use `setcap` to grant network capabilities without full sudo:

````bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=+ep /usr/local/bin/seed
```python

### Can I run The Seed on a server without a GUI?

Yes! The Seed is a web application:

- Backend runs on server (headless)
- Web UI accessed from any browser (on network)
- Perfect for VM, cloud instance, Raspberry Pi

Example: Run on Ubuntu server, access UI from laptop browser.

## Features

### Can The Seed plan WiFi coverage BEFORE doing a site survey?

**Yes!** This is The Seed's unique feature: **Predictive WiFi Planning**.

1. Upload floor plan (PNG, PDF, CAD)
2. Mark walls, obstructions
3. Place virtual APs
4. Get instant heatmap (predicted coverage)
5. Optimize AP placement BEFORE buying hardware

**No competitor has this.** Ekahau, Hamina, etc. require an on-site survey first.

### How accurate is the WiFi predictive planning?

**Typical accuracy:** 85-95% compared to real-world survey.

#### Good enough for

- Estimating AP count (how many do I need?)
- Budget planning (before proposal)
- Initial design (before site visit)

#### Not a replacement for

- Final validation (always do on-site survey for critical deployments)
- Complex RF environments (stadiums, warehouses with metal/concrete)

### Does The Seed replace SolarWinds / PRTG / Nagios?

**For SMBs and healthcare:** Yes! The Seed covers 90% of use cases:

- Network discovery
- Device monitoring
- Alerting
- Performance metrics
- WiFi monitoring

**For large enterprises (10,000+ devices):** No. SolarWinds, Datadog, etc. are designed for massive scale and deep
integrations. The Seed targets SMBs, not Fortune 500.

### Does The Seed replace Ekahau?

**For small projects and predictive planning:** Yes! The Seed offers:

- Predictive WiFi planning (Ekahau doesn't have this)
- 60% cheaper ($1,999 vs $5,198)
- Cross-platform (Ekahau is Windows-only)

**For large consultant firms:** Maybe not. Ekahau is the industry standard with:

- Extreme accuracy (critical for stadiums, warehouses)
- Professional reports (clients expect Ekahau branding)
- Deep AP vendor integrations

## Security and Privacy

### Does The Seed send data to the cloud?

**No.** The Seed is **self-hosted** - all data stays on your network.

- No telemetry sent to Mustard Seed Networks
- No usage tracking
- No cloud dependencies

**Exception:** License validation (checks license key status, but doesn't send scan data).

### Is The Seed HIPAA compliant?

Yes! The Seed is designed for healthcare:

- **Self-hosted:** Data never leaves your network (meets HIPAA data sovereignty)
- **Encryption:** AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Audit logs:** Track all user actions (who did what, when)
- **Compliance reports:** Generate HIPAA security risk assessments

**Note:** You are responsible for your overall HIPAA compliance. The Seed is a tool to _help_ you comply, not a complete
solution.

### What data does The Seed collect?

#### During network scans

- IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames
- Open ports, services
- OS fingerprints
- SNMP data (if configured)

#### Stored locally

- Scan results (in SQLite database)
- Config files (YAML)
- Logs (application logs, audit logs)

#### Never collected

- Network traffic content (no DPI, no packet inspection beyond headers)
- Passwords (except hashed admin passwords for web UI login)
- Personal health information (PHI)

---

## Troubleshooting

### The Seed isn't finding all my devices. Why?

#### Common causes

1. **Firewall blocking ICMP:** Some devices block ping.
   - **Fix:** Enable TCP port scan (Settings then Discovery then Methods then TCP)

2. **Wrong subnet:** Scanning 192.168.0.0/24 but devices are on 192.168.1.0/24
   - **Fix:** Check your subnet (`ip addr` on Linux, `ifconfig` on macOS)

3. **Insufficient timeout:** Some devices respond slowly.
   - **Fix:** Increase timeout (Settings then Discovery then Timeout then 60 seconds)

4. **VLANs:** Devices on different VLANs not discovered.
   - **Fix:** Configure SNMP to query managed switches, or add multiple subnets

5. **Permissions:** Packet capture requires root/admin.
   - **Fix:** Run with `sudo` or grant capabilities (`setcap`)

### Web UI won't load. What's wrong?

#### Check

1. **Is The Seed running?**

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep seed
```text

```text

   If not, start it: `seed` (or `sudo systemctl start seed` if using systemd)

2. **Is port 8080 in use?**

   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080  # macOS/Linux
```text

If another service is using 8080, stop it or configure The Seed to use different port.

3. **Firewall blocking?**
   - Check firewall rules: `sudo ufw status` (Ubuntu) or `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all` (RHEL)
   - Allow port 8080: `sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp`

4. **Wrong URL?**
   - Local: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Remote: `http://<server-ip>:8080`

### Speed test fails / shows 0 Mbps. Why?

#### Common causes

1. **No internet connection:** Speed test requires internet.
   - **Fix:** Check gateway: `ping 8.8.8.8`

2. **Firewall blocking:** ISP or firewall blocking speed test servers.
   - **Fix:** Temporarily disable firewall or allow speed test domains

3. **VPN active:** Speed test measures VPN speed, not actual internet.
   - **Fix:** Disconnect VPN and retest

### How do I reset the admin password?

#### Option 1: Reset via CLI (if you have shell access)

```bash
seed reset-password admin
# Enter new password when prompted
```text

#### Option 2: Reset via config file

1. Stop The Seed: `sudo systemctl stop seed`
2. Delete user database: `rm ~/.config/seed/users.db`
3. Start The Seed: `sudo systemctl start seed`
4. Run setup wizard again (creates new admin user)

#### Option 3: Reset all data (nuclear option)

```bash
sudo systemctl stop seed
rm -rf ~/.config/seed
sudo systemctl start seed
```python

**Warning:** This deletes all scan history, settings, and user accounts.
