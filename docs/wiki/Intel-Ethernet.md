## 💻 Installation & Setup

### PCIe Card Installation (I210, I350)

1. **Check PCIe slot compatibility:**
   - I210: PCIe x1 (fits any x1, x4, x8, x16 slot)
   - I350: PCIe x4 (fits x4, x8, x16 slot)

2. **Install card:**

   ```bash
   # Power off system
   # Insert card into PCIe slot
   # Connect power if required (usually not)
   # Boot system
   ```

3. **Verify detection:**

   ```bash
   lspci | grep -i ethernet
   # Should show: Intel Corporation I210 Gigabit Network Connection
   # or: Intel Corporation I350 Gigabit Network Connection

   dmesg | grep igb
   # Should show driver loading successfully
   ```

4. **Check interface name:**

   ```bash
   ip link show
   # Look for new interface (eth0, eno1, enp3s0, etc.)
   ```

### Verify TDR Support

```bash
# Test TDR capability
sudo ethtool --cable-test eth0

# Expected output if supported:
# Cable test started for eth0.
# Cable test completed for eth0.
# Pair A code: OK
# Pair A length: 15m
# (etc.)

# If not supported:
# netlink error: Operation not supported
```

---

## 🔧 Using TDR Cable Testing

### Basic Cable Test

```bash
# Start cable test
sudo ethtool --cable-test eth0

# Wait 10-30 seconds for results
# Results will be printed automatically
```

### Example Output - Good Cable

```
Cable test started for eth0.
Cable test completed for eth0.
Pair A code: OK
Pair A length: 23m
Pair B code: OK
Pair B length: 23m
Pair C code: OK
Pair C length: 23m
Pair D code: OK
Pair D length: 23m
```

### Example Output - Open (Disconnected) Cable

```
Cable test started for eth0.
Cable test completed for eth0.
Pair A code: Open
Pair A length: 2m
Pair B code: Open
Pair B length: 2m
Pair C code: Open
Pair C length: 2m
Pair D code: Open
Pair D length: 2m
```

**Interpretation:** Cable is unplugged or broken at ~2m from NIC

### Example Output - Short Circuit

```
Cable test started for eth0.
Cable test completed for eth0.
Pair A code: Short within Pair
Pair A length: 15m
Pair B code: OK
Pair B length: 45m
Pair C code: OK
Pair C length: 45m
Pair D code: OK
Pair D length: 45m
```

**Interpretation:** Pair A is shorted at ~15m (damaged cable)

### Interpreting Results

**Status Codes:**

- **OK** - Pair is functioning normally
- **Open** - Pair is disconnected (no connection)
- **Short within Pair** - Wires within pair are touching
- **Short to Another Pair** - CrossTalk/interference
- **Impedance Mismatch** - Wrong cable type or damaged insulation

**Length Accuracy:**

- **±2-5m typical** - Acceptable for fault locating
- **Affected by:** Cable quality, temperature, installation
- **Not calibrated** - For diagnostics, not surveying

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: "Operation not supported" for TDR

**Symptoms:**

```bash
sudo ethtool --cable-test eth0
netlink error: Operation not supported
```

**Cause:** NIC doesn't support TDR (wrong chipset)

**Solution:**

- Verify chipset: `lspci | grep -i ethernet`
- If not I210/I350/I225-V: TDR not supported
- **Recommendation:** Purchase Intel I210 or I350

### Issue: TDR Test Hangs

**Symptoms:** `ethtool --cable-test` never completes

**Solution:**

```bash
# Kill hung test
sudo pkill ethtool

# Unload and reload driver
sudo modprobe -r igb
sudo modprobe igb

# Try test again
sudo ethtool --cable-test eth0
```

### Issue: Inaccurate Length Readings

**Symptoms:** Length reported doesn't match known cable length

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Cable quality** - Low-quality cable affects TDR
2. **Temperature** - Cold cables test longer
3. **Solid vs stranded** - Different propagation velocities

**Mitigation:**

- Use known-good cables for calibration
- Understand ±5m accuracy limitation
- Compare multiple cables

### Issue: I225-V Link Drops (Rev A0/A1)

**Symptoms:** Link randomly disconnects and reconnects

**Cause:** Firmware bug in early I225-V revisions

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check revision
ethtool -i eth0 | grep firmware

# If firmware shows A0 or A1:
# Update motherboard BIOS (may include NIC firmware update)
# Or replace with rev A2+ card
```

## 🔬 Advanced Usage

### Scripted Cable Testing

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test all Intel NICs

for iface in $(ls /sys/class/net/ | grep -E 'eth|eno|enp'); do
    driver=$(ethtool -i $iface 2>/dev/null | grep driver | awk '{print $2}')

    if [[ "$driver" == "igb" || "$driver" == "igc" || "$driver" == "e1000e" ]]; then
        echo "=== Testing $iface ($driver) ==="
        sudo ethtool --cable-test $iface
        echo ""
        sleep 2
    fi
done
```

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor link status
watch -n 2 'ethtool eth0 | grep -E "Link|Speed|Duplex"'

# Monitor for link flaps
while true; do
    ethtool eth0 | grep "Link detected"
    sleep 1
done
```

### Integration with The Seed

```bash
# Run The Seed with Intel NIC
sudo ./seed --interface eth0

# The Seed will automatically detect TDR support
# and enable cable diagnostics card in UI
```
