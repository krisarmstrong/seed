## 🚀 Flagship Feature: Predictive WiFi Survey

**Issue:** [#591](https://github.com/krisarmstrong/seed/issues/591) **Milestone:** WiFi Intelligence (v0.130.0)
**Priority:** CRITICAL

### What It Does

1. Upload floor plan image
2. Mark walls and materials (drywall, concrete, etc.)
3. Place virtual access points
4. Get instant coverage prediction (heatmap)
5. Run what-if scenarios ("What if I move this AP?")
6. Export professional PDF report with BOM

### Why It's Unique

**NO COMPETITOR OFFERS THIS.**

- Ekahau ($2-5K): Manual surveying only
- NetAlly ($10K+): No predictive capability
- NetSpot: Basic heatmaps, no prediction

### Value Delivered

- Save $2K-5K per deployment (eliminate trial & error)
- 50% reduction in site survey time
- Get WiFi right the first time
- Professional reports for clients

### Technical Approach

- RF propagation modeling (Free Space Path Loss, Log-Distance)
- Wall attenuation calculations (drywall: 3-4dB, concrete: 10-15dB)
- Multi-AP interference modeling
- Ray tracing for obstacle detection
- Genetic algorithm for AP placement optimization

**This feature alone justifies the $1,999/year Premium tier.**
